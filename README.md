# 100 days of Problem Solving for Tech Interviews

⚡️ For the next 100 Days, I'l code at least one problem everyday in Javascript (and maybe C++?). Might as well construct a platform to share the problems and solutions.

⚡️ Problem statement is in the top - commented. I'll try to put up various solutions to the same problem. (I'm just practicing, right? :))

⚡️ To run the files on your local for ease of use -

1. Install `Code Runner` Extension.
2. `ctrl` + `option` + `n` to run any file in the code.
