Visit [Algochurn](https://algochurn.com) - For hands on practice and solutions for the coding questions present in this repository.

### Questions taken from: 
- [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com)
- [Algoexpert](https://algoexpert.io)
- [Hackerrank](https://hackerrank.com)
- [Cracking The Coding Interview - Book](https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/)

⚡️ For the next 100 Days, I'll code at least one problem everyday in Javascript (and maybe C++?). Might as well construct a platform to share the problems and solutions (DID IT - [Algochurn](https://algochurn.com)).

⚡️ Problem statement is in the top - commented. I'll try to put up various solutions to the same problem. (I'm just practicing, right? :))

⚡️ To run the files on your local for ease of use -

1. Install `Code Runner` Extension.
2. `ctrl` + `option` + `n` to run any file in the code.
